## 📖 Project Overview

**Budget Management App** is a full-stack solution designed to help users track their income and expenses while generating real-time financial reports.

What makes this project unique is its **methodology**: it was architected, developed, and deployed in an intensive **2.5-day micro-sprint** by a team of 3 developers working in tandem with AI Assistants (GitHub Copilot, Open Code). The project serves as a case study for **AI-First Software Development**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a **Microservices Architecture** with an Event-Driven design for decoupling heavy processing.

### 1. Frontend (Modular Monolith)

- **Main Tech**: React 19, TypeScript 5.9, Vite 7.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4, Shadcn/UI (Radix UI).
- **State Management**: Zustand (Global UI state), TanStack Query (Server state & caching).
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication.
- **Routing**: React Router DOM (Modular Architecture).
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (Linting, Unit Tests, Build).

### 2. Backend (Microservices)

- **Language**: Java 17 (Eclipse Temurin).
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 4.0.2.
- **Architecture**: Event-Driven Microservices.
  - **Transaction Service**: Handles income/expense CRUD operations and publishes `TransactionCreated` events to RabbitMQ.
  - **Report Service**: Listens to RabbitMQ events to aggregate financial summaries and analytics.
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 (One DB per service: `transactions_db`, `reports_db`).
- **Communication**: RabbitMQ (Message Broker).

### 3. devOps & Infrastructure

- **Infrastructure**: Docker & Docker Compose for orchestration.
- **CI/CD**: Fully automated pipeline via GitHub Actions.

## 🤖 AI Workflow Methodology

We adopted a hybrid **Agile-DevOps** workflow specifically adapted for AI collaboration:

- **Micro-Sprints**: Intensive 2.5-day development cycle.
- **Roles**: Frontend, Backend, and QA Engineers working with AI.
- **Prompt Engineering**: We standardized prompts for code generation, QA testing, and documentation (see `PROMPT_DOCUMENTATION/`).
- **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines generated and optimized by AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (Essential for Backend)
- **Node.js 18+** (For Frontend)
- **Java 17 JDK** (Optional, if running backend without Docker)

### Step 1: Start the Backend (Infrastructure)

The backend services (Transactions, Reports, MySQL, RabbitMQ) are containerized.

```bash
cd app/backend-microservice/docker-compose/production
docker-compose up -d
```

_This starts the MySQL databases, RabbitMQ broker, and both Spring Boot Microservices._

### Step 2: Start the Frontend

Run the React application locally.

```bash
cd app/Frontend
npm install
# Ensure you have a .env file configured (see .env.example)
npm run dev
```

_Access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or as specified by Vite)._
