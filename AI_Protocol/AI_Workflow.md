## 1. Methodology

### Agile-DevOps Hybrid Approach
For this 2.5-day intensive app development project, we combine lightweight Agile practices with DevOps principles:

#### **Agile Adaptation (Scrum-inspired)**
Given our 2.5-day constraint, we adapt Scrum to micro-sprints:

- **Sprint Duration:** 1 day per sprint (2 total sprints)
- **Daily Standup:** 2-3 hour daily meeting (detailed structure in Section 4)

**Day 1 Sprint Goals:**
- Project setup and architecture
- Time planning and structure of the project
  
**Day 2 Sprint Goals:**
- Feature completion
- Testing and bug fixes
- Deployment and documentation

#### **DevOps Principles**
- **Continuous Integration:** Commit code frequently, trigger automated checks
- **Continuous Deployment:** Deploy to staging/production environments rapidly
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Version control all configurations
- **Automated Testing:** Integrate tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Monitoring:** Track app performance and errors from day one

#### **AI Integration**
- GitHub Copilot and Open Code as Junior Developer member of our team
- Apply prompt engineering best practices https://docs.github.com/es/copilot/concepts/prompting/prompt-engineering
- Ethics and Quality Standards (detailed in section 5)
- Document AI interactions for team learning in PROMPT_DOCUMENTATION.md

## 2. Key Interactions

### Types of AI Interactions


#### **A. Debugging**
Encountering errors, unexpected behavior, or failing tests

---

#### **B. Code Improvement**
Enhancing code quality, performance, readability, or maintainability

---

#### **C. Documentation**
 Writing README files, API documentation, code comments, or user guides

---

#### **D. Testing**
**When to use:** Creating unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests

---

## 3. Key Documents and Context

### A. Project Context Documents

Maintain these key documents in the repository:

```
📁 majoymajo/Taller_Diagnostico
├── 📄 README.md                    → Project overview, setup, installation
├── 📄 AI_Workflow.md   → This document
├── 📄 ARCHITECTURE.md              → System design, tech stack, structure
├── 📄 PROMPT_DOCUMENTATION.md      → Prompts used on each role
    ├──Front-End.md
    ├──Back-End.md
    ├── QA.md
├── 📄 TEST.md                      → Testing strategy and commands
├── 📄 DEPLOYMENT.md                → Deployment process and environments


```

### B. Context Template for AI Interactions

Before requesting AI assistance, gather this information:

```markdown
## Context for AI Interaction

**Project**: Budget Management App
**Repository**: majoymajo/Taller_Diagnostico
**Task**: [What you're trying to achieve]
**Current file**: [Full file path]
**Related files**: [Other relevant files]
**Tech Stack**: 
  - Language: [JAVA]
  - Framework: [React, Sprint]
  - Broker : Rabbit MQ
  - Infra: Docker
**Constraints**: [Limitations, requirements, deadlines]
**Previous attempts**: [What you've already tried]
**Error message** (if applicable): [Full error with stack trace]
```

---

### C. Example of Good Contextualization

**Example 1: Code Generation**
> "In our React Native app (majoymajo/Taller_Diagnostico), I'm building a product catalog screen. We use React Navigation v6, Redux Toolkit for state, and Styled Components for styling. I need a FlatList component that displays products from the Redux store, includes pull-to-refresh, and handles loading/error states. Each product card should show image, name, price, and rating. Follow our existing component structure in `src/components/`."

**Example 2: Debugging**
> "In our Node.js Express API, the POST /api/users endpoint in `src/routes/userRoutes.js` returns a 500 error when creating users. Error: 'Cannot read property 'hash' of undefined' in `src/controllers/userController.js:23`. We use bcrypt for password hashing and Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL. Here's the controller code: [code]. Database connection is working for GET requests."

- **No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data**

### B. Ethical Guidelines

✅ **Acceptable Use:**
- Using AI to accelerate development
- Learning from AI explanations
- Getting suggestions for improvements
- Generating boilerplate and tests

❌ **Unacceptable Use:**
- Copying AI code without understanding
- Sharing sensitive project data with AI
- Using AI to bypass learning fundamentals
- Claiming AI work as entirely original without disclosure
- Violating licenses or intellectual property

### C. Data Privacy
- **Never share:** API keys, passwords, tokens, personal user data
- **Sanitize inputs:** Remove sensitive info before sharing with AI
- **Review outputs:** Ensure AI doesn't generate inappropriate content
