## 1. Methodology

### Agile-DevOps Hybrid Approach

For this 2.5-day intensive app development project, we combine lightweight Agile practices with DevOps principles:

#### **Agile Adaptation (Scrum-inspired)**

Given our 2.5-day constraint, we adapt Scrum to micro-sprints:

- **Sprint Duration:** 1 day per sprint (2 total sprints)
- **Daily Standup:** 2-3 hour daily meeting (detailed structure in Section 4)
  **Day 1 Sprint Goals:**
- Project setup and architecture
- Time planning and structure of the project

**Day 2 Sprint Goals:**

- Feature completion
- Testing and bug fixes
- Deployment and documentation

#### **DevOps Principles**

- **Continuous Integration:** Commit code frequently, trigger automated checks
- **Continuous Deployment:** Deploy to staging/production environments rapidly
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Version control all configurations
- **Automated Testing:** Integrate tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Monitoring:** Track app performance and errors from day one

#### **AI Integration**

- GitHub Copilot and Open Code as Junior Developer member of our team
- Apply prompt engineering best practices https://docs.github.com/es/copilot/concepts/prompting/prompt-engineering
- Ethics and Quality Standards (detailed in section 5)
- Document AI interactions for team learning in PROMPT_DOCUMENTATION.md

### B. Context Template for AI Interactions

Before requesting AI assistance, gather this information:

```markdown
## Context for AI Interaction

**Project**: Budget Management App
**Repository**: majoymajo/Budget_Management_App
**Task**: [What you're trying to achieve]
**Current file**: [Full file path]
**Related files**: [Other relevant files]
**Tech Stack**:

- Language: [JAVA]
- Framework: [React, Sprint]
- Broker : Rabbit MQ
- Infra: Docker
  **Constraints**: [Limitations, requirements, deadlines]
  **Previous attempts**: [What you've already tried]
  **Error message** (if applicable): [Full error with stack trace]
```

---

### C. Example of Good Contextualization

**Example 1: Code Generation**

> "In our React Native app (majoymajo/Budget_Management_App), I'm building a product catalog screen. We use React Navigation v6, Redux Toolkit for state, and Styled Components for styling. I need a FlatList component that displays products from the Redux store, includes pull-to-refresh, and handles loading/error states. Each product card should show image, name, price, and rating. Follow our existing component structure in `src/components/`."

**Example 2: Debugging**

> "In our Node.js Express API, the POST /api/users endpoint in `src/routes/userRoutes.js` returns a 500 error when creating users. Error: 'Cannot read property 'hash' of undefined' in `src/controllers/userController.js:23`. We use bcrypt for password hashing and Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL. Here's the controller code: [code]. Database connection is working for GET requests."
